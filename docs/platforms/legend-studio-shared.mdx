[Legend](https://github.com/finos/legend) provides an **end-to-end data platform experience covering the full data lifecycle**. It encompasses the [**Legend-Pure language**](https://github.com/finos/legend-pure) and a suite of data management and governance tools known as the **Legend Platform**, which allows engineers and non-engineers alike to describe, connect, visualize, and query high-quality data. 

**Learn more about Legend at [legend.finos.org](https://legend.finos.org).**

## Shared Public Instance of Legend Studio
FINOS hosts a shared instance of Legend Studio at [https://legend.finos.org/studio](https://legend.finos.org/studio). The shared instance of Legend Studio is provided free-of-charge and as-is. It is primarily intended to be used for shared modeling efforts conducted by FINOS members and other non-member community participants as part of [FINOS hosted projects or initiatives](https://landscape.finos.org/).

Learn about the projects that are currently leveraging the shared instance of Legend Studio in the "modeling initiatives" section of the [FINOS Landscape](https://landscape.finos.org/). The shared instance was also used by participants in the [FINOS Legend Studio pilot (April-September 2020)](https://www.finos.org/press/goldman-sachs-open-sources-its-data-modeling-platform-through-finos). 

Anyone is welcome to [request an account on the shared instance](https://www.finos.org/legend). Requests for accounts will be fulfilled based on FINOS staff availability as well as the rationale stated below for wanting an account and/or any connection between a request and the work of an ongoing FINOS project. Additional consideration will be also given to account requests from FINOS members.

### Default project configuration and permissions

Any modeling initiative that is accessible by the FINOS Shared instance is hosted on a GitLab project within the https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation/Legend group.

The following configurations are enforced across all projects:
- `master` branch is protected by direct commits, only Merge Requests are allowed
- Merge Requests must be approved by at least one [Code Owner](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners.html)

The following permissions are applied:
- `Reporters` can read [Legend workspaces](https://legend.finos.org/docs/studio/create-workspace); everyone can apply to become a `Reporter` on any of the modeling initiatives hosted in FINOS, just [request an account](https://www.finos.org/legend).
- `Developers` can create workspaces and submit changes; they must be covered by [FINOS CLA](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements)
- `Maintainers` can review and merge changes; they must be covered by [FINOS CLA](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements) and are elected following the [standard FINOS Governance Policies](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Software-Projects/CONTRIBUTING.template.md)
