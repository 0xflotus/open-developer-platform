The ODP Project team is tasked with advising and prioritizing the building and managing of FINOS infrastructure that FINOS members are able to access for communication and open source software development.

The team collaboratively maintains a [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/8) of requirements, and the FINOS Infra team - with the help of FINOS Community - independently works through that backlog in priority order.

The ODP Project was approved by the PMC on 21 June 2018.
