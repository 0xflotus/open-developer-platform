## Slack Channel Request

Let us know if your FINOS project needs a dedicated public channel on https://finos-lf.slack.com/ for real-time, synchronous project team communications.

**Please note** : All FINOS project channels in https://finos-lf.slack.com/ are _**"public"**_, unless explicitly stated why a _**"private"**_ channel is required.

## GitHub Team Discussions Request

Let us know if your FINOS project needs a GitHub Team created in the [FINOS Organisation](https://github.com/finos/) to enable [GitHub Team Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-team-discussions). Information on GitHub Team Discussions for asynchrounous team communication is found in the [Communications Section](https://odp.finos.org/docs/project-collaboration#conversations) of the ODP Microsite.

**Please note** : Only team members who have accepted an invitation to join the [FINOS Organisation](https://github.com/orgs/finos/people) can view and partake in GitHub Team Discussions. This is also subject to [FINOS CCLA and ICLA requirements](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements#ContributionComplianceRequirements-ContributorLicenseAgreement).
