## Project Slack Channel Request

Let us know if your FINOS project needs a dedicated public channel on https://finos-lf.slack.com/ for real-time, synchronous project team communications.

**Please note** : All FINOS project channels in https://finos-lf.slack.com/ are _**public**_, unless explicitly stated why a _**private**_ channel is required.

## Project GitHub Team Discussions Request

Let us know if your FINOS project needs a GitHub Team created in the FINOS Organisation for [GitHub Team Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-team-discussions). 

Information on how GitHub Team Discussions enables asynchrounous team communication is found in the [Communications Section](https://odp.finos.org/docs/project-collaboration#conversations) of the [ODP Microsite](https://odp.finos.org/).
